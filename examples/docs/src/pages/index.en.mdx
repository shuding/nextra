# Akira

Akira (Japanese: アキラ) is a 1988 Japanese animated `post-apocalyptic cyberpunk` action film
directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, produced by Ryōhei Suzuki and Shunzō Katō, and written by Otomo
and Izo Hashimoto, based on Otomo's 1982 manga of the same name. The film had a production
budget of ¥700 million ($5.5 million), making it the most expensive anime film at the time
(until it was surpassed a year later by Kiki's Delivery Service).

# `<Banner>` Component

Show a banner on the top of the website. It can be used to show a warning or a
notice.

## Props

<TSDoc componentName="Banner" />

### Banner key

A banner can be dismissed. By default, it's used by
[localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
to keep the banner state on the client.

If you have updated your banner text, you should change the key to make sure the
banner is shown again. The best practice is to always use a descriptive key for
the current text, for example:

![Banner](/assets/docs/banner.png)

```jsx filename="app/layout.jsx" {7-11}
import { Layout } from 'my-nextra-theme'
import { Banner } from 'nextra/components'

export default function MyLayout({ children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Banner storageKey="2.0-release">
        <a href="https://nextra.site" target="_blank">
          ðŸŽ‰ Nextra 2.0 is released. Read more â†’
        </a>
      </Banner>
      {children}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

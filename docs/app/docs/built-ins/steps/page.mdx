component to display them as visual steps. You can choose the appropriate
heading level based on the content hierarchy on the page.

appear in the Table of Contents, replace the Markdown headings `### ...` with
`<h3>` HTML element wrapped in curly braces.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```diff filename="MDX"
<Steps>

+ {<h3>Step 1</h3>}

Contents for step 1.
</Steps>

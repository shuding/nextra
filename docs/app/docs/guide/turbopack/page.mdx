# Usage with Turbopack `next dev --turbopack`

1. mention `.jsx`/`.tsx` (and even `.ts` for someone?) extension doesn't work
   for `mdx-components` file
1. mention relative images fails to load on development mode (Turbopack bug, not
   affect production, since Webpack is still used there)
1. mention about serializable options only

```text
Error: loader nextra/loader for match "./{src/app,app}/**/page.{md,mdx}" does not have serializable options.
Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
```

# Next.js Link

All relative Markdown links are automatically converted into
[Next.js links](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating).
This means that the target page will be prefetched. When you click on a link,
the page will be loaded on the client-side like a
[Single-Page Application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application),
without making a full page load. For example:

```md filename="Markdown"
Click [here](/about) to read more.
```

Will be equivalent to:

```mdx filename="MDX"
import Link from 'next/link'

Click <Link href="/about">here</Link> to read more.
```

This feature makes navigation between Nextra pages fast and seamless.

# Next.js Image

The standard way to use
[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
inside MDX is to directly import the component:

```mdx filename="MDX"
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/demo.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
```

## Static image

> [!NOTE]
>
> This feature is enabled via `staticImage: true` in the Nextra config by
> default.

Nextra supports automatically optimizing your static image imports with the
Markdown syntax. You do not need to specify the width and height of the image,
just use the `![]()` Markdown syntax:

```md filename="Markdown"
![Hello](/demo.png)
```

This loads the `demo.png` file inside the `public` folder, and automatically
wraps it with Next.js `<Image>`.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also use `![](../public/demo.png)` to load the image from a relative
> path, if you don't want to host it via `public`.

With Next.js Image, there will be no layout shift, and a beautiful blurry
placeholder will be shown by default when loading the images:

![Nextra](/opengraph-image.jpeg)

## Image zoom

> [!NOTE]
>
> The image zoom feature is enabled globally by default.

In the default configuration, if you want to use this feature, simply insert
images using `![]()` Markdown syntax.

### Disable image zoom

For `nextra-docs-theme` and `nextra-blog-theme`, you can disable image zoom by
replacing the `img` component used in MDX.

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
import { Image } from 'nextra/components'

export default {
  // ... your other configurations
  components: {
    img: props => <Image {...props} />
  }
}
```

### Enable/disable image zoom for specific images

When zoom is **disabled globally**, but you want to enable it for specific
images, you can do so by using the `<ImageZoom>` component:

```mdx
import { ImageZoom } from 'nextra/components'

<ImageZoom src="/demo.png" />
```

When zoom is **enabled globally**, and you want to disable zoom for a specific
image, you can simply use the `<Image>` component:

```mdx
import { Image } from 'nextra/components'

<Image src="/demo.png" />
```

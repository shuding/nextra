## Usage with Your Own Theme

If you want to benefit this feature with your own theme and your own `<Callout>`
component:

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Create a `Blockquote` Component

Import `withGitHubAlert` from `nextra/component` and create `Blockquote`
component by calling `withGitHubAlert` function, where 1st argument your regular
`<blockquote>` component and 2nd argument React HOC component which will be
called when matching GitHub alert syntax, where `type` prop is
`'note' | 'tip' | 'important' | 'warning' | 'caution'{:ts}`

```jsx
import { withGitHubAlert } from 'nextra/components'

const Blockquote = withGitHubAlert(
  MyBlockquoteComponent,
  ({ type, ...props }) => {
    return <MyCalloutComponent type={type} {...props} />
  }
)
```

### Provide `Blockquote` to `useMDXComponents`

```jsx filename="my-mdx-components.js"
export function useMDXComponents(components) {
  return {
    blockquote: Blockquote,
    ...components
  }
}
```

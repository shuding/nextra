# Next.js Link

All relative Markdown links are automatically converted to
[Next.js links](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating).
This means that the target page will be prefetched. And when you click on a
link, the page will be loaded on the client-side like a Single-Page Application
[(SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), without making a
full page load. For example:

```md
Click [here](/about) to read more.
```

Will be equivalent to:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

Click <Link href="/about">here</Link> to read more.
```

This feature makes navigation between Nextra pages fast and seamless.

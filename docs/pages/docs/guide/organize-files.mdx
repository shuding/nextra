# Organize Files

Nextra first collects all your Markdown files and configurations from the
`pages` directory, and then generates the “page map information” of your entire
site, to render things such as the _navigation bar_ and _sidebar_ below:

## Default Behavior

By default, the page map contains all `.md` and `.mdx` filenames and the
directory structure, sorted alphabetically. Then, Nextra will use the
[title](https://github.com/vercel/title) package to get formatted page names
from filenames.

For example if you have the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="contact.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="legal.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The resolved page map will be (note that all names were sorted alphabetically):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "About",
    "children": [{ "name": "Index" }, { "name": "Legal" }]
  },
  { "name": "Contact" },
  { "name": "Index" }
]
```

And the global page map will be bundled to each page by Nextra. Then, configured
theme will render the actual UI with that page map.

## `_meta.json`

It's very common to customize each page's title, rather than just relying on
filenames. Having a page titled "Index" lacks clarity. It is preferable to
assign a meaningful title that accurately represents the content, such as
"Home".

That’s where `_meta.json` comes in. You can have an `_meta.json` file in each
directory, and it will be used to override the default configuration of each
page:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="contact.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="legal.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

And you can put this in your `pages/_meta.json` file:

```json filename="pages/_meta.json"
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "about": "About Us"
}
```

It tells Nextra the order of each page, and the correct title. Alternatively,
you can do it with `title` and have other configurations in there as well:

```json filename="pages/_meta.json"
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "about": {
    "title": "About Us",
    "...extra configurations...": "..."
  }
}
```

The extra configurations are passed to the **theme** as additional information.

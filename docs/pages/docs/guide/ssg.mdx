# Next.js SSG

With Next.js, you can pre-render your page using
[Static Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).
Your pages will be generated at build time and statically served to visitors. It
can also be cached by a CDN to maximize the performance.

This is supported by Nextra too. Here's an example:

import { useData } from 'nextra/data'

export const getStaticProps = ({ params }) => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(repo => ({
      props: {
        // We add an `ssg` field to the page props,
        // which will be provided to the Nextra `useData` hook.
        ssg: {
          stars: repo.stargazers_count
        }
      },
      // The page will be considered as stale and regenerated every 60 seconds.
      revalidate: 60
    }))
}

export const Stars = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { stars } = useData()
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}

<div className="mt-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 p-4 dark:border-gray-900">
  Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
</div>

The number above was generated at build time via `getStaticProps`. With
[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration)
enabled, it will be kept up to date.

Here's the MDX code for the example above:

```mdx
import { useData } from 'nextra/data'

export const getStaticProps = ({ params }) => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(repo => ({
      props: {
        // We add an `ssg` field to the page props,
        // which will be provided to the Nextra `useData` hook.
        ssg: {
          stars: repo.stargazers_count
        }
      },
      // The page will be considered as stale and regenerated every 60 seconds.
      revalidate: 60
    }))
}

export const Stars = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { stars } = useData()
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}

Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
```

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can enable Turbopack in development by appending the `--turbopack` flag to
> the `dev` command:
>
> ```diff filename="package.json"
> - "dev": "next",
> + "dev": "next --turbopack",
> ```

You can start the server in development mode with the following command
according to your package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

or in production mode:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build
npm run start
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is
> significantly slower since Next.js compiles every page you navigate to.

### Add Next.js config

Create a `next.config.mjs` file in your project's root directory with the
following content:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  // ... Other Nextra config options
})

// You can include other Next.js configuration options here, in addition to Nextra settings:
export default withNextra({
  // ... Other Next.js config options
})
```

With this configuration, Nextra will handle Markdown files in your Next.js
project. For more Nextra configuration options, check out the
[Guide](/docs/guide).

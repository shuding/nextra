like React's `useState` hook with an additional helper callback.",

    "remarks": "This hook was created to make prototyping easier and our documentation
examples clearer. Although it is OK to use this hook in production, in
practice you may want to use a more sophisticated state management solution
like Zustand {@link https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/state-management/} instead.",
    "returns": "- `edges`: The current array of edges. You might pass this directly to the `edges` prop of your
`<ReactFlow />` component, or you may want to manipulate it first to perform some layouting,
for example.

- `setEdges`: A function that you can use to update the edges. You can pass it a new array of
edges or a callback that receives the current array of edges and returns a new array of edges.
This is the same as the second element of the tuple returned by React's `useState` hook.

- `onEdgesChange`: A handy callback that can take an array of `EdgeChanges` and update the edges
state accordingly. You'll typically pass this directly to the `onEdgesChange` prop of your
`<ReactFlow />` component.",

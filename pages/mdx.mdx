# MDX

Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about) to use React components inside your Markdown file:

<Callout emoji="✅">
  MDX (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX. It receives an MDX string and outputs a JSX string. It does this by parsing the MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that tree. 
</Callout>

Syntax _highlighting_ is also supported:

```jsx highlight=4
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```
